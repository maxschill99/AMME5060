Check equation is symmetric
get seperate subroutines working
try mlevel for special case
parallelise code
set up solver for both conjugate gradient and normal - need to properly set up initial condition
get communication and solution initialisation sorted - for parallelisation


Conjugate gradient method
TO DO:
    Update preconditioning solver
