get seperate subroutines working
try mlevel for special case


*** PRIORITIES ***
Check equation is symmetric (might need to do steady state)
parallelise code - implement communication within jacobi and conjugate gradient module
set up solver for both conjugate gradient and normal - need to properly set up initial condition
get communication and solution initialisation sorted - for parallelisation
try to implement red-black jacobi solver

Implement local indices
Implement communication
Initialise variables with parallelisation


Conjugate gradient method
TO DO:
    Update preconditioning solver

QUESTIONS
    Where does the communication occur in the conjugate gradient method
