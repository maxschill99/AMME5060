get seperate subroutines working
try mlevel for special case


*** PRIORITIES ***
Check equation is symmetric
parallelise code
set up solver for both conjugate gradient and normal - need to properly set up initial condition
get communication and solution initialisation sorted - for parallelisation
try to implement red-black jacobi solver


Conjugate gradient method
TO DO:
    Update preconditioning solver
