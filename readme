Choice of topology and solver type can be changed between line 19 and 25 in main.f90
Note that conjugate gradient solver type has still been included, but the outputted results dont match jacobi and redblack

The varmod_MP.f90 contains all the variables used in solver calculation including diffusion constant, grid size, time step and max residual

A makefile has been implemented for ease of computation and the executible file is test1.exe



F90 Files:
main.f90 - main script to run code from
varmod_MP.f90 - variable initialisation
outputmod_MP.f90 - produces TecPlot file
nodemod_MP.f90 - gets the nodes of each processor domain
partitioning_MP.f90 - partitions the domain based on the chosen decomposition method
residuals.f90 - computes the residual matrix of the current iteration
init.f90 - Initialises the Ax = b matrices and allocates the variable dimensions
jacobi.f90 - computes the updated temperature using jacobi and redblack
